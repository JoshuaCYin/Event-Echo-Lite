## Getting Started

To set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaCYin/Event-Echo-Lite.git

```

## Ways to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- Fix bugs
- Suggest or add new features
- Improve documentation
- Help with testing
- Review pull requests

## Branching and Commit Guidelines

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. Name it clearly, for example:
  - `feature/add-login`
  - `fix/fix-typo`

These are the main categories, as this is a basic project. The feature category includes changes/enhancements in addition to new features.

- Keep your commits small and focused on a single change.

- Write clear commit messages that briefly explain what you changed, for example:
  - `Add user login functionality`
  - `Fix typo in README`

- Before pushing, make sure your branch is up to date with the main branch:
```
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

- Push your branch and open a pull request when ready.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug or unexpected behavior, please open an issue and include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected and actual results
- Any relevant screenshots or code snippets
- Your operating system and environment details, if helpful

## Suggesting Enhancements

To suggest a new feature or improvement, open an issue with:

- A clear title
- A short description of the feature
- Why it would be helpful
- Any initial ideas for implementation, if you have them

Label the issue as `enhancement` if possible.

## Submitting Changes

To contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch:
```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```
3. Make your changes and commit them:
```
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```
4. Push to your fork:
```
git push origin your-branch-name
```
5. Open a pull request from your forked repository

Please write clear commit messages and provide a short summary of what your pull request changes. A team member will review your submission and give feedback.

## Code Style Guide
